**What-Why-Who**
====================================



What is *GeoBatch* 
------------------------------------
*GeoBatch* is an open source Java enterprise application for the collection, processing and publication of geospatial data in real time
*GeoBatch* is a processing engine aimed toward the processing of geographic data. 
*Geobatch* is an event-based geospatial aware batch processing system to easy the development, the deploy, and the management of jobs on streams of geospatial data. Geobatch provides basic components for the collection, processing and pubblication of data.
*GeoBatch* basic idea is to apply a **chain of actions** on some defined events. The predefined event generators include monitoring for new files added into a directory, or receiving files into the embedded FTP server.
Actions range from geotransforming an input raster file, to embedding overviews, to publishing the received data into a public *GeoServer*.
*GeoBatch* also provides **users profiles**, in order to give different user the privileges to admin the processes or to monitor the processes status.


Why use *GeoBatch*
-----------------------------------
Because you can use **free and open source software** 
is free software. This significantly lowers the financial barrier to entry when compared to traditional products. In addition, not only is it available free of charge, it is also open source. Bug fixes and feature improvements in open source software are greatly accelerated when compared to traditional software solutions. Leveraging GeoBatch in your organization also prevents software lock-in, saving costly support contracts down the road.
