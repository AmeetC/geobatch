About the Themes:

The geobatch theme is a custom geobatch theme with the same style of the Geobatch landing page but it is still under construction.

The geosolutions theme is the geosololutions geoserver training theme patched for geobatch (removed the training license and changed the header banner) and is actually the used theme from GeoBatch 1.3_BETA_4 release.
